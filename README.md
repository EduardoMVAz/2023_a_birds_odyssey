"2023: A Birds Odyssey" is a python based game development project, made entirely utilizing pygame. Our main focus with this project was honing our skills with both Object-Oriented Programming and Basic Linear Algebra Concepts. With these objectives in mind, our project is strongly Object-Oriented, with a special care for code organization and minimizing repetition.
